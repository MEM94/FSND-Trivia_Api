The application must:
Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
Delete questions.
Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
Search for questions based on a text query string.
Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
Completing this trivia app will give you the ability to structure plan, implement, and test an API - skills essential for enabling your future applications to communicate with others.
